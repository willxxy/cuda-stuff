Learning how nvidia gpus work

## Running CUDA code (at least for now. when we get to args and stuff later, we'll probably modify this)

1. nvcc cuda_program.cu -o where_to_put_the_executable
2. ./where_you_put_the_executable

Note: All executables will be in the `execs` directory.

## System Info

1. `smCount.cu` - counts the number of sms on all gpus.
